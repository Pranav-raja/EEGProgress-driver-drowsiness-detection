🍊 In this study, a progressive convolution CNN architecture named "EEGProgress" is proposed, aiming to efficiently extract the topological spatial information of EEG signals from multi-scale levels (electrode, brain region, hemisphere, global) with superior speed.

🧰 How to run
🍊 You can directly run the code with “test.py”.

📕 Prerequisites
🍊 Before running the application, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:
